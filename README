This is a solver for the 1000bitcoin challenge
https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx

It can be configured for a specific puzzle with the constants in src/main.rs
It will start at a random point within the search space and try out addresses one after another.
It runs only on the cpu and using only one thread.
For multithreading, just start the program multiple times lol.

Since this solver only runs on the cpu its probably too slow for any practical purpose, so you should not use it.
